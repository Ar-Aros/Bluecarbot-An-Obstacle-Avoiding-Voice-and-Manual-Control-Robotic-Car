It is an Arduino-based robotic project. We have built a robotic car using Arduino, a sonar sensor, Bluetooth and other necessary components. It can avoid obstacles in auto mode using a sonar sensor. It can be controlled by a phone application over Bluetooth. It can also be controlled over voice commands with the phone application.
